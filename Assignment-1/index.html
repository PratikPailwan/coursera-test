                    Welcome to HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers! I'm excited to have you in the class and look forward to helping you build cool front-end web applications.               
                    I've always felt that a lot of web developers "tinker" with HTML/CSS/Javascript. It is my hope to take you way beyond just tinkering with these technologies.

                    If the EUâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation or equivalent legislation in Switzerland or the UK (collectively, the GDPR) applies to your use of Firebase, the updated Data Processing and Security Terms will deem the SCCs to apply automatically. If the GDPR does not apply to your use of Firebase, these updates have no practical impact</p>

                    We are updating the Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms and Crashlytics and App Distribution Data Processing and Security Terms to add the relevant SCCs as adopted by the European Commission, which, as per the ruling, can continue to be a valid legal mechanism to transfer data outside of the EU, Switzerland or the UK.</p>
