            <p class="innerP">hello this is me Dear Pratik R Pailwan,
                Welcome to HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers! I'm excited to have you in the class and look forward to helping you build cool front-end web applications.               
                I've always felt that a lot of web developers "tinker" with HTML/CSS/Javascript. It is my hope to take you way beyond just tinkering with these technologies. I am hoping you'll see their power and understand how to harness that power for the good.                
                A TON of work went into choosing the content and creating proper presentation and delivery of that content for you. I hope it shows!</p>
